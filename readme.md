Queueing inspired metamodeling of an outpatient clinic
-------------------------------------------------------

Using known results for the transient D/M/1 queueing system
along with non-linear adjustment terms to build metamodels
for an outpatient clinic simulation experiment. This analysis
serves as a second case study in a paper we have under review.

Key files include

- `transient_dm1_mm.qmd` - Quarto markdown document with the analysis for the paper,
- `data/xy_q.csv` - data file needed to reproduce analysis
- `lib/parsnip_tps.R` - custom R functions needed for automation of nls model fitting
